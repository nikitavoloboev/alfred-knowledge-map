## Install
Download the workflow from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-learn-anything/releases/latest).

## Contributing
[Suggestions](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-learn-anything/issues) and pull requests are highly encouraged!

## Developing
If you want to add features and things to the workflow. It is best to use [this Alfred CLI tool](https://godoc.org/github.com/jason0x43/go-alfred/alfred) which you can install by running:

`go install github.com/jason0x43/go-alfred/alfred`

You can then run `alfred link` inside this repo you cloned. This will make a symbolic link of the [`workflow`](workflow) directory.

You can then make your changes to the code and after run `alfred build` to build the go binary to `workflow` directory. Which you can then use from inside Alfred [script filters](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/inputs/script-filter/).

## Credits
The workflow is built using [Deanishe](https://github.com/deanishe)'s amazing [AwGo](https://github.com/deanishe/awgo) library.
