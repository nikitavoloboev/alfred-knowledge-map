# Help extend it to other launchers ðŸŽŠ

If you are interested in indexing these mind maps in this way but are not using macOS or Alfred. I am very interested in extending this implementation to other launchers like [Cerebro](https://cerebroapp.com/) or [Mutate](https://github.com/qdore/Mutate) or any other launcher. 

Essentially you have to parse [these markdown files](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-knowledge-map/tree/master/md) with links to mind maps in a format that your launcher supports. If you do have the time or interest for it, I am open to any kind of pull request to add support to more launchers.

# Thank you ðŸ’™

Big thank you to [Vitor](https://github.com/vitorgalvao) who kindly shared the script to parse the markdown files and [Dean](https://github.com/deanishe) who sorted out the mess I was doing with trying to set this workflow up.
