## Installing
Download the workflow from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-learn-anything/releases/latest).

## Contributing
[Suggestions](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-learn-anything/issues) and pull requests are highly encouraged!

## Developing
If you want to add features and things to the workflow. I advise you to install [this Alfred CLI tool](https://godoc.org/github.com/jason0x43/go-alfred/alfred) by running:

`go install github.com/jason0x43/go-alfred/alfred`

You can then make your changes to the code and then run `alfred build` inside this repo to build the go binary to `workflow` directory. Which you can then use from Alfred script filters.
